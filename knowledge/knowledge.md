What we're going to cover
Are you ready?

We've got a lot to go through.

* Get time series data (the historical price of Bitcoin)
    * Load in time series data using pandas/Python's CSV module
* Format data for a time series problem
    * Creating training and test sets (the wrong way)
    * Creating training and test sets (the right way)
    * Visualizing time series data
    * Turning time series data into a supervised learning problem (windowing)
    * Preparing univariate and multivariate (more than one variable) data
* Evaluating a time series forecasting model
* Setting up a series of deep learning modelling experiments
    * Dense (fully-connected) networks
    * Sequence models (LSTM and 1D CNN)
    * Ensembling (combining multiple models together)
    * Multivariate models
    * Replicating the N-BEATS algorithm using TensorFlow layer subclassing
* Creating a modelling checkpoint to save the best performing model during training
* Making predictions (forecasts) with a time series model
* Creating prediction intervals for time series model forecasts
* Discussing two different types of uncertainty in machine learning (data uncertainty and model uncertainty)
* Demonstrating why forecasting in an open system is BS (the turkey problem)

**By the end of this project**, we'll have a solid understanding of how to approach time series forecasting problems using deep learning with TensorFlow.
